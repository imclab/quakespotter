TODO:
* Nice textual display of info for a quake.
* Pretty glowing OPENGL bars or mounds coming up out of each quake.
* Use arrow keys to tab around quakes, sorted by longitude.
* Optimize the globe-rendering code.
* Hook into the USGS's ground shake maps ... display 'em.
* Volcanoes too?
* Make some epicenter-y graphics for quake badges. (color tint magnitude?)


DONE:
